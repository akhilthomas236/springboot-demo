# Spring Boot Application

This is a basic Spring Boot application generated using Spring Initializr with the Web dependency. It uses Maven as the build tool.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java (JDK 17+) and Maven installed.
2. In the project root, run:

   mvn spring-boot:run

The application will start on http://localhost:8080 by default.

## Project Structure
- `src/main/java` - Java source code
- `src/main/resources` - Application configuration
- `pom.xml` - Maven build file

## Next Steps
- Add your REST controllers in `src/main/java/[your/package]/`
- Customize your application as needed.
